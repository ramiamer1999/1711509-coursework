For the past month now, I have been part of a team with the goal of creating an app with a purpose. The catch is that it's supposed to use hardware called Arduino and software also aptly named Arduino. We have a timeframe of a month to accomplish this.

I have learned so much working with other people and it was clear from the start that team skills and synergy are pivotal to the realisation of any team goal. That being said, the project is coming along nicely and we'll finish before the deadline. I'll post pictures of the final product when the time comes as well.
