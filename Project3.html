This is a little different from what you would expect but if you're familiar with Nexus Mods then you probably know what this project is all about.

</p>

<p>

Nexus is a website where a community of various people create and share files that alter games for the improvement of perfomnace or fun of said game. Yes, this is one of my recreational extra curricular activities which doesn't sound as boring as it may sound especially once you get to know how enticing it is.

</p>

<p>

Right now, I am collaborating with 3 other people to recreate files for a game using its assets and we're doing this to both help the community and to gain positive publicity too. It is very rewarding to work along side these people because you learn so much from other users on Nexus. These guys are the best when it comes to coding, if you want to learn something new, you learn from the best.
