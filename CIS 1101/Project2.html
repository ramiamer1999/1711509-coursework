When I was in High-School, I was intrigued by the Cisco Networking class some of my classmates were taking. This was 3 years ago, mind you, so it was quite some time ago. After looking into this subject more with the help of my friends and my old Computer Science teacher, I was interested in taking this subject and learning networking. I enrolled in the Cisco Networking class the following year and it was without a doubt worth it.

<p>

We would mainly use one application in that class, which was Packet Tracer and thus, that was the only networking app I ever got acquainted with but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Packet Tracer has grown on me over the years and I am fluent with its use. I have used it on my time off school to practise network topologies and designing.

<p>

Since July I have been designing a network topology, for practise at first, but later on for a business idea, after seeing the potential the initial topology had. Pitching it to small businesses or home offices may sound like a simple idea but it forms the basis of gaining practical experience in both social skills such as negotiation, persuasion, bargaining, and knowledge of business management as well. Regardless, taking the time to practise skills pays off and networking is not exempted from this.
