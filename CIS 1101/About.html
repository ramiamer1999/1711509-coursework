         Hello, I am Rami Amer. I am from Cyprus and I study Computer Science at Robert Gordon University. I am knowledgable in many fields of computer science, but my strongest skill is computer software in general. My trade skills are programming and networking.

         <p>

            One of the main reasons I chose to pursue a career in Computer Science is because of my extensive programming experience from Middle-school to High-school. Networking is my secondary skill which I picked up as a hobby in the past few years. I love to work with Networking and in fact, one of my current </p> <a href="file:///C:/Users/Rami/Documents/CIS%201101/Projects2.html">projects </a><p>that I am wokring on is Local Area Network Management. It is based in Packet tracer, a program I am very familiar with. There is many projects I have worked on in the past, if you want to see some of my projects that I'm working on, click</p><a href="file:///C:/Users/Rami/Documents/CIS%201101/Projects.html">here.</a>

         <p>

           Two phrases that could best describe me are motivation and hard work. I have a strong work ethic and I would cherish an opportunity to earn first hand experience working in the field of computing software with a strong and supportive group of people.
